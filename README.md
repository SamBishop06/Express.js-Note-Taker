## Installation
load the repository, move to the designated directory (where server.js is located), and make sure to install the dependencies by executing "npm i" in the command line.

## Usage
After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, open the command line, navigate to the correct folder (if necessary), and enter "npm start" into the command line. This action should initiate a localhost server at port 3001. You can then either type "localhost:3001" into your browser's address bar or copy the address from the command line. The application should now be fully operational.
